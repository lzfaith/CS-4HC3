# MOSAIC

## Instruction
1. Ensure that your computer is connecting to a network. (our program uses some external resources, which requires to connect to a network)
2. Ensure that all the files of the program are in the same folder.
3. Double click `index.html` so that it will be opened in a browser, or right clip to choose open with another browser. (As our program is developed with the help of Google Chrome, we recommand to use Chrome to open the program.)

## Remarks
1. Because of some technical hurdles, we simplified our design and focus on course enrollment and schedule. 
2. All the data is fake and static, so whatever your username of the login page is, the information on the other pages is always the same.
